# CrackStationWrapper

A test harness for the `CrackStation` assignment in CS 561.

## Usage

Add a git URL under `dependencies` in the `Package.swift` file.  If the student repository is private (as it probably should be), then make sure the student adds you as a *collaborator*.  Then, use the ssh git link for the git URL.  For the version tag to work, the student must `git tag` their release using *semantic versioning* (e.g. `git tag 1.0.0`).
